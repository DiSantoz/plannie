Each individual time block allows the user to enter a task and then save the task to the planner. Don't worry about exiting the browser, the task will be saved to the planner!

The planner dynamically changes as the day progress. Any time in the past will display a grey color on the time slot, current time slots will be red and tasks in the future will be green.
